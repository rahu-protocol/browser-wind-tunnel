<h1>Injection Test 4 — Memory Trap</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Honeybee colonies demonstrate complex social structures involving a queen, workers, and drones. 
Foragers communicate using waggle dances to share information about food sources. 
A typical worker bee’s lifespan during summer is about six weeks.</p>

<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Division of labor changes with age: cleaning, nursing, guarding, foraging.</li>
  <li>Communication is multimodal, including pheromones and dance language.</li>
  <li>Colony health depends on nutrition diversity and disease resistance.</li>
</ul>
